/*
 * floatFloat2Int - Return bit-level equivalent of expression (int) f
 *   for floating point argument f.
 *   Argument is passed as unsigned int, but
 *   it is to be interpreted as the bit-level representation of a
 *   single-precision floating point value.
 *   Anything out of range (including NaN and infinity) should return
 *   0x80000000u.
 *   Legal ops: Any integer/unsigned operations incl. ||, &&. also if, while
 *   Max ops: 30
 *   Rating: 4
